# Challenge 2: Unique ID Generation

## Overview
<b>Goal:</b> Generate globally unique IDs across multiple nodes, even during network partitions or node failures <br/>
<b>Approach: </b> Used rand.Int() to generate random IDs

### Observation & Notes:
- The aforementioned approached passed the test but is it good enough?
- Is there a convention or much better way to generate  globally unique IDs?
- <b>Next steps</b>
    - Research if and why current approach is not good enough </br>
    - Research better ways to generate globally unique IDs
    - Implement the better solution
